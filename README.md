# netviewer

Currently no direction in this project, just an exploration in python/flask.

# Setup
- Run the commands listed in `virtualenv.bash` to set up the python environment
- (BUG) Note that chaining the commands will exit the venv, it's better to just run them one by one
- Once in the (venv) command prompt just run `start.bash` and navigate to localhost:5000 on any browser

# Helpful commands
- `deactivate` will exit the python venv
